## project experience 
Portfolio Project: Forsisatria
Web-Based Savings and Loan Information System with ElGamal Encryption
Project Description
Forsisatria is a cooperative savings and loan web application that I developed using Laravel, with a focus on customer data security.
In this system, I implemented ElGamal encryption to protect sensitive data such as identity numbers and account numbers so that they are not stored in plaintext in the database.
During the development process, I used AI as a learning reference, then studied, adapted, and reimplemented it according to the system's needs.
### Results:
• Customer sensitive data is not easily accessible by irresponsible hackers<br>
• Makes it easier for customers to save and borrow money<br>
### What I have learned so far:
Acquiring the basics of vulnerability penetration by
learning Wireshark, Nmap, SQLmap, and BrubSuite tools to analyze traffic and detect threats on the network and detect threats.
## Certifications and Training
### Training and Platform:
Following learners on several learning platforms such as<br>
• Udemy<br>
• Coding Studio<br>
the materials I took were web security & bug bounty and nmap master, computer network fundamentals, penetration testing fundamentals or ethical hacking, and Linux command line.
## Career Goals
To become a Cyber Security Professional who identifies various security vulnerabilities in systems and applications, provides appropriate and effective mitigation solutions, and contributes to improving the security level of information systems from cyber threats and attacks.
